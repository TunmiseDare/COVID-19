COVID-19 Pandemic Response: Unpacking the Impact of Diagnostic Testing

Repository Overview;

This data-driven project investigates the critical role of diagnostic testing in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, leveraging publicly available data from January to July 2020.

Data Sourcing;

My analysis relies on curated data from Worldometer, encompassing:

- COVID-19 case numbers
- COVID-19-related fatalities
- COVID-19 testing volumes

Data Preparation;

I conducted minimal data preprocessing, aggregating records by date and continent. Testing rates were calculated to facilitate in-depth analysis.

Analytical Approach;

Utilizing Power BI, my analysis encompasses:

- Temporal analysis of COVID-19 case and fatality trends
- Correlative analysis between testing rates and COVID-19 case numbers
- Data visualization to illuminate key insights

Key Takeaways;

My investigation yields crucial findings on the efficacy of diagnostic testing in controlling COVID-19:

- Nations with elevated testing rates exhibited reduced COVID-19 case incidence
- Monthly case count declines correlated with increased testing rates
- A robust correlation existed between testing rates and COVID-19 case numbers.
